Hi! I'm Luke. I'm currently an undergraduate student (sophomore at the time of writing) studying Math-CS and Education Studies at Brown University. Before that, I attended George School in Newtown, PA, where I discovered my passion for my current majors.

I'm still trying to discover what I want to do in life. My goal right now is to find which academic field truly sparks my interest!

I'm all over the place when it comes to hobbies. Check out my "Fun" page and feel free to reach out via email!
