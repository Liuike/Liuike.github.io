This is my first post on my new personal site. ðŸŽ‰

I actually had no intention of writing this, but the AI that wrote this site did immediately as I told it I want a blog section (and yes I vibe coded this entire site like a good AI-dependent modern programmer). Which takes me to something I want to comment on after working an internship this summer and building this site: Damn, vibe coding actually works. 

You see, my last experience with AI code writing was back in high school, back during the GPT-3 era. It was good, but nowhere near its current capabilities. It's crazy how it can not only understand massive projects but also just make your ideas work. I've been avoiding AI as much as possible during my college coursework b/c I still wanted to learn, but damn is this ever convenient. Might have to force myself to not abuse this for school work as well...

Anyways, I'll be writing random things on my blog, don't really expect anyone to read them but who really cares. 

For now, have some ideas to make this website more polished and adding some interesting features: 
- Writing blogs on the web instead of in markdown locally and then pushing to github and go through all the hassle (yes I hate it)
- Chinese/English toggle? Really need to write some Chinese again before I forget how to write
- Want to add more interesting things in the fun page, lack of creativity strikes again...
