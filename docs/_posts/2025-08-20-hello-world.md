This is my first post on my new GitHub Pages site. ðŸŽ‰

I've successfully integrated a clean, minimal personal website structure that includes:

- **Custom layouts** for different page types
- **Responsive design** with modern CSS
- **Navigation system** with About, Projects, and Blog pages
- **Blog functionality** with post listings
- **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment

Feel free to explore the site and check out the different pages!

## What's Next?

I plan to:
- Add more content to the About and Projects pages
- Customize the design further
- Write more blog posts about my development journey
- Add some portfolio projects

Stay tuned for more updates!
